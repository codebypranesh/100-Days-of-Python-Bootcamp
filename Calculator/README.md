---

## Description
The Calculator program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can perform consecutive calculations and choose whether to continue with the result or start a new calculation.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Choose an operator from the displayed options (+, -, *, /).
4. Enter the next number to perform the calculation.
5. Decide whether to continue calculating with the result, start a new calculation, or exit the program.

## Example
```python
Enter the first number: 10
Choose the Operator: +
Enter the next number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15.0, 'n' to start a new calculation, or 'exit' to quit: y
Enter the next number: 2
15.0 + 2.0 = 17.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 17.0, 'n' to start a new calculation, or 'exit' to quit: exit
Exiting calculator. Goodbye!
