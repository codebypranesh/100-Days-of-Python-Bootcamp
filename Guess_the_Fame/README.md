# Guess the Fame: High or Low

---

## Description
The Higher Lower Game is an interactive guessing game where players compare the follower counts of different celebrities. Players must guess which celebrity has more followers, accumulating points for each correct guess.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. Compare the follower counts of two celebrities presented.
3. Type 'A' if the first celebrity has more followers, or 'B' if the second celebrity does.
4. Continue guessing until you get it wrong or choose to quit the game by typing 'q'.

## Example
```python
Compare A : Ariana Grande, a musician, from the United States
v / s
Against B : Justin Bieber, a musician, from Canada
Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B' : A
You're right! Current Score = 1

Compare A : Justin Bieber, a musician, from Canada

Against B : Kim Kardashian, a media personality, from the United States
Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B' : B
Better luck next time! Final Score: 1
