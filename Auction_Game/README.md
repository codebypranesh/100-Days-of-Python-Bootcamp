# Secret Auction

---

## Description
The Secret Auction program allows users to place bids on an item anonymously. Participants can enter their names and bid amounts, and the program will determine the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in your Python environment.
2. Enter your name and bid amount when prompted.
3. After each bid, you will be asked if there are any other bidders.
4. Continue entering bids until you indicate that there are no more bidders.
5. The program will then display the highest bidder and their bid amount.

## Example
```python
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your BID amount: 150
Is there any other user to BID? (yes/no)
yes

Enter your name: Bob
Enter your BID amount: 200
Is there any other user to BID? (yes/no)
no

The Highest Bidder is Bob with a bid amount of 200
```
